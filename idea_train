Khaliq and I were thinking along these lines:
Twitter bot that checks for hashtage #NerdPoints, each time it's tweeted
that user gets points ( maybe anybody who is included in the tweet
 gets points too, or maybe you can only give them.. thinking out
loud here)
Then have a simple leaderboard of 1) all your friends 2) state 3) global etc etc

... what were you thinking?


As a motivator for us, we have an internal nerdpoint tally for pushes...
